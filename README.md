Hooray! Hooray! It’s New Year’s Day! 

The day we start anew. 

So this year I’ve decided 

To become a kangaroo!


Or maybe i will learn to fly, 

Or how to walk through walls, 

Or how to turn invisible, 

Or surf on waterfalls.


I’ll make myself elastic 

And I’ll teach myself to shrink. 

I’ll turn into a liquid 

And I’ll pour me down the sink.


I’ll visit other planets 

And meet aliens galore. 

I’ll travel to the distant past 

And ride a dinosaur.


I’ve got so many wondrous plans. 

I’m starting right away. 

Yes, this will be the best year yet. 

Hooray! It’s New Year’s Day!
